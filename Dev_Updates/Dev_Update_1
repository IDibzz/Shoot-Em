1. Player has been added and all functionalitys for it moving
2. Projectiles added, change in speed if character is moving or not. Collisions for projectiles with enemies also added.
3. Enemies/thingys added. Score goes up if projectile hit them.
4. Gun added that is tracked around the player as the mouse moves. Projectiles now shoot from the "Gun".

To Do (short term): have enemies have unique movements that try to get to the palayer, have other enimies have guns that shoot at the player too with unique movements. 
TLDR: enemie types need to be added

To do (long term): add multiroom stages like into the gungeon that get progressively harder. Also add powerups that change gun behavior. Need art too, I dunno how to dat....
