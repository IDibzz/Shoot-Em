Hi there im Andrew Mendez an asipring Data Science Major at the University of Arkansas.
I hope to further my skills in python through game development, EDAs, and what not.
This game will be a classic 2d room by room shooter. Themes and art will be thought of another time in the future.
Thats about it, I'll make sure to add dev updates for it as it becomes developed.
